* Object Relational Mapping ORM.
- An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables
- into objects that are more commonly used in application code.
- ORMs also make it theoretically possible to switch an application between various relational databases. For example, a developer
- could use SQLite for local development and MySQL in production. A production application could be switched from MySQL to PostgreSQL
- with minimal code modifications.
